# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create enhanced serverless API entry point



  - Replace the basic `backend/api/index.ts` with a complete Express app setup
  - Integrate Prisma client with singleton pattern for serverless environment
  - Configure CORS for production environment with proper origin handling


  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.4_

- [ ] 2. Integrate all existing routes into serverless entry point
  - Import and configure empresas routes in the API entry point
  - Import and configure ejecucion routes in the API entry point  


  - Import and configure supervision routes in the API entry point
  - Ensure all route paths are properly prefixed with /api
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [x] 3. Integrate middleware stack for serverless environment


  - Adapt and integrate errorHandler middleware for serverless functions
  - Adapt and integrate notFoundHandler middleware for proper 404 handling
  - Adapt and integrate requestLogger middleware with serverless-optimized logging
  - Integrate validation middleware for request validation
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.1, 4.2_



- [ ] 4. Enhance health check endpoint with database connectivity
  - Modify health check to test database connection using Prisma
  - Add environment and version information to health response
  - Include timestamp and database status in health check response


  - Handle database connection errors gracefully in health check
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.3_

- [ ] 5. Optimize Vercel configuration for complete application
  - Update vercel.json to properly include all Prisma schema files



  - Configure function settings for memory and timeout optimization
  - Ensure proper file inclusion for all backend dependencies
  - Verify route configuration matches the enhanced API structure
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

- [ ] 6. Test deployment configuration locally
  - Create local test script to verify the enhanced API entry point works
  - Test all API endpoints through the new serverless entry point
  - Verify middleware integration works correctly in serverless context
  - Test database connectivity and operations through the new entry point
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.3_

- [ ] 7. Implement proper error handling for serverless environment
  - Ensure Prisma errors are properly caught and formatted
  - Add timeout handling for serverless function limits
  - Implement graceful degradation for database connection issues
  - Add comprehensive logging for debugging deployment issues
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_
