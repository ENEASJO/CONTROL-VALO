# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Control de Valorizaciones de Obras application is experiencing deployment failures on Vercel. The main issue is that the backend API entry point (`backend/api/index.ts`) is incomplete and doesn't properly integrate with the existing application routes and controllers. This feature will fix the deployment configuration to ensure the full-stack application deploys successfully on Vercel with all API endpoints working correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend API to be properly configured for Vercel deployment, so that all existing routes and controllers are accessible in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed to Vercel THEN the backend API entry point SHALL include all existing routes (ejecucion, supervision, empresas)
2. WHEN the API entry point is configured THEN it SHALL properly initialize Prisma client for serverless environment
3. WHEN the API routes are accessed THEN they SHALL respond with the same functionality as in local development
4. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return a successful response indicating API is working

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Vercel configuration to be optimized for the full-stack application, so that both frontend and backend deploy correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the vercel.json is configured THEN it SHALL properly route API calls to the backend entry point
2. WHEN the frontend is built THEN it SHALL be served correctly from the dist directory
3. WHEN Prisma is used in serverless functions THEN the schema and client SHALL be properly included
4. WHEN environment variables are set THEN the database connection SHALL work in production

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all application features to work in production, so that I can use the system without deployment-related errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the deployed application THEN all pages SHALL load correctly
2. WHEN making API calls from the frontend THEN they SHALL successfully communicate with the backend
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL work correctly with the production database
4. WHEN CORS is configured THEN frontend-backend communication SHALL work without cross-origin errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging in the deployment, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in the API THEN they SHALL be properly caught and logged
2. WHEN the API fails to start THEN it SHALL provide meaningful error messages
3. WHEN database connection fails THEN it SHALL handle the error gracefully
4. WHEN debugging deployment issues THEN logs SHALL be accessible and informative
